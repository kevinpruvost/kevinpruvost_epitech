# MUL_my_hunter_2018

## 1st Graphical project of the first "C Graphical Programming" module of the Epitech's 1st year program.

My_hunter is a project where we had to learn how to make our first video game thanks to the CSFML library.

The final rendering had to be a Duck Hunt-like.

I was not really inspired so I just used the original sprites and some ducks pictures.

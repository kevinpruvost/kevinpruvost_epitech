# MUL_my_defender_2018

## 1st Graphical project of the second "C Graphical Programming" module of the Epitech's 1st year program.

The "my_defender" projet is the first C Graphical project we needed to make in groups.

The purpose of this project was to create a Tower Defense game, we had about 1 month to make it.

This project was also our first big project. We wrote ~ 5900 lines of code.

I made a map editor, 4 different types of towers, an upgrade, sell and a free placing system (just limited to dirt paths and

user interface), and a settings menu to modify sounds' and music's volume.

Once again, my project was on Shrek's Universe.

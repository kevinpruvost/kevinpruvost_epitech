            Useful informations :
            
                If you want to exit from the map editor, you have to make
                a complete map. To make it fast, just press the RANDOM button.

                Turrets are intelligent, if they are meant to slow the ennemies
                they will not spam them, they will change to another target to slow
                as much ennemies as possible contrary to DOT turrets, but there is a
                reason, DOTs can accumulate.

       Pro tips :

           - Shreks have technically the best DPS.
           - Fionas can finish ennemies more easily.
           - Knights have armor, Dragons ignore it, but Dragons do not focus Knights !
           - Donkeys can save your games by slowing ennemies, so use it !
           - Upgrading donkeys is useless, ennemis will not be more slowed.
           - You can place turrets next to Shrek's House, use this advantage,
           very useful, especially when the map is overfilled with path squares.

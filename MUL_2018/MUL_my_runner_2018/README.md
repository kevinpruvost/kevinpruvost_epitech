# MUL_my_runner_2018

## 2nd Graphical project of the first "C Graphical Programming" module of the Epitech's 1st year program.

The My_runner project is the second graphical project of the C Graphical Module of the 1st year program of Epitech.

We had to make a Geometry Dash clone with the CSFML library.

The graphics of my project were inspired by Shrek.

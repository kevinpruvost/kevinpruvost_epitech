# CPE_solostumper_1_2018

## A project-exam we had to make in 4 hours.

The solo stumpers are sessions where we had to make a program alone (there were 3 different subjects to avoid cheating)</br>
during 4 hours and make it as rigorous as possible by making a strong error management.

We had 6 tries to complete this module and I succeeded at the first try.

The program I had to make was named "countwords", it was a program which was counting in a sentence the  </br>
number of times the words present in the sentence appeared. I had to display them in the order they appeared, </br>
and only alphanumeric characters had to be treated.

# CPE_pushswap_2018

## 2nd Project of the first "Elementary Programming in C" module of the Epitech's 1st year program.

The purpose of the "pushswap" project was to sort a list of numbers given in arguments.</br>
But the sorting had to be made only with 2 lists and with specific commands : </br>
-sa   swap the first two elements of l_a (nothing will happen if there aren’t enough elements).</br>
-sb   swap the first two elements of l_b (nothing will happen if there aren’t enough elements).</br>
-sc   sa and sb at the same time.</br>
-pa   take the first element from l_b and move it to the first position on the l_a list (nothing will happen if l_b is empty).</br>
-pb   take the first element from l_a and move it to the first position on the l_b list (nothing will happen if l_a is empty).</br>
-ra   rotate l_a toward the beginning, the first element will become the last.</br>
-rb   rotate l_b toward the beginning, the first element will become the last.</br>
-rr   ra and rb at the same time.</br>
-rra  rotate l_a toward the end, the last element will become the first.</br>
-rrb  rotate l_b toward the end, the last element will become the first.</br>
-rrr  rra and rrb at the same time.</br>

# CPE_pushswap_2018

## 2nd Project of the first "Elementary Programming in C" module of the Epitech's 1st year program.

The purpose of the "pushswap" project was to sort a list of numbers given in arguments. </br>
But the sorting had to be made only with 2 lists and with specific commands : </br>
| Commands | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| [sa]         | swap the first two elements of l_a (nothing will happen if there aren’t enough elements). |

| [sb]       | swap the first two elements of l_b (nothing will happen if there aren’t enough elements). |
| [sc]       | sa and sb at the same time. |
| [pa]       | take the first element from l_b and move it to the first position on the l_a list (nothing will happen if l_b is empty). |
| [pb]       | take the first element from l_a and move it to the first position on the l_b list (nothing will happen if l_a is empty). |
| [ra]       | rotate l_a toward the beginning, the first element will become the last. |
| [rb]       | rotate l_b toward the beginning, the first element will become the last. |
| [rr]       | ra and rb at the same time. |
| [rra]      | rotate l_a toward the end, the last element will become the first. |
| [rrb]     | rotate l_b toward the end, the last element will become the first. |
| [rrr]      | rra and rrb at the same time. |

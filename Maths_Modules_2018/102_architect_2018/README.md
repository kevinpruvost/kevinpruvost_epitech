# 102_architect_2018

## 2nd project of the first Mathematics module of the Epitech's 1st year program.

I made this project with Valentin L-Homel.

In this project, we had to compute points images in a plan after several transformations that were :
- Translation.
- Scaling.
- Rotation centered at O.
- Reflection over any axis that passes through O.
- Any combination of those transformations.

# 103_cipher_2018

## 3rd project of the first Mathematics module of the Epitech's 1st year program.

In this project (I made with Valentin L-Homel), we had to make a program that can crypt and decrypt a message using matrices.
We had to use at least 2D & 3D matrices, but we made it, for a bonus, to 4D & 5D matrices with Gaussian Elimination.

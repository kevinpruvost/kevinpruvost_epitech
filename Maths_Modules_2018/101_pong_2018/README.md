# 101_pong_2018
## 1st project of the first Mathematics module of the Epitech's 1st year program.

This project was meant to be a program that computes and displays :
- The velocity vector of a ball.
- The coordinates of the ball after a given amount of time.
- The angle at which the ball will hit the bat (if it will indeed hit the bat, at anytime from t = 0).

I worked on this project with Valentin L-Homel.
After the program was completed, each one of us made a bonus.

He made a Breakout game using CSFML library, in C.

And I made a Pong game using Game Maker Studio, in C++, only playable on Windows.

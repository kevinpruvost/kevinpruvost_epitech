# 105_torus_2018


## 5th and last project of the first Mathematics module of the Epitech's 1st year program.

The torus project a little bit like the architect projet but this time we got more complex geometric forms,
instead of circles, cones and cylinders, we now have a torus, a donut-like geometric shape.
And instead of 2nd degree equations, we now have a 4th degree equation.
To compute we need to deal with the problem with 3 methods :
- The bissection method.
- The Newton's method.
- The secant method.
To do so, we were given in arguments, which method of these 3 we will use, the coefficients
of the equation and the precision expected.

# 104_intersection_2018

## 4th project of the first Mathematics module of the Epitech's 1st year program.

The meaning of this project was to understand some basics of synthesis images, we had to compute
intersection points between light rays and scene objects, to do so, we were given arguments which told
us if the surface of the objects were cylinders, spheres or cones, the coordinates of the point where the light
ray will pass through, a vector parallel to the same light ray and a parameter which is the radius of
the sphere or the radius of the cylinder or the angle formed by the cone and the Z-axis.

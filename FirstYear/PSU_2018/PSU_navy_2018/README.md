# PSU_navy_2018

## 1st Project of the second "Unix system programming" module of the Epitech's 1st year program.

In this project, we had to recreate the Navy game. A game where 2 players have to destroy every </br>
boats of the map of the opposite player. When every boats of one player are destroyed, he loses the game.

We had to make it only playable on the Linux terminal and with ASCII characters and with a map given in arguments </br>
for the first player and the pid of the first player's program and a map given in arguments for the second player.

The main goal of this project was to learn and understand the signal.h library.

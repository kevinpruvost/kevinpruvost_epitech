# PSU_my_minishell1_2018

## 2nd Project of the second "Unix system programming" module of the Epitech's 1st year program.

The purpose of this project was to make a part of a tcsh shell.
The conditions were to make the minishell able to use every bin commands like " ls " or " rm ".

Next to that, we needed to remake " cd ", " env ", " exit " and make " setenv " and " unsetenv ".

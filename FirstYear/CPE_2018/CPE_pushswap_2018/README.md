# CPE_pushswap_2018

## 2nd Project of the first "Elementary Programming in C" module of the Epitech's 1st year program.

The purpose of the "pushswap" project was to sort a list of numbers given in arguments. </br>
But the sorting had to be made only with 2 lists and with specific commands : </br>

| Commands | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| sa         | swap the first two elements of l_a (nothing will happen if there aren’t enough elements). |
| sb       | swap the first two elements of l_b (nothing will happen if there aren’t enough elements). |
| sc       | sa and sb at the same time. |
| pa       | take the first element from l_b and move it to the first position on the l_a list (nothing will happen if l_b is empty). |
| pb       | take the first element from l_a and move it to the first position on the l_b list (nothing will happen if l_a is empty). |
| ra       | rotate l_a toward the beginning, the first element will become the last. |
| rb       | rotate l_b toward the beginning, the first element will become the last. |
| rr       | ra and rb at the same time. |
| rra      | rotate l_a toward the end, the last element will become the first. |
| rrb     | rotate l_b toward the end, the last element will become the first. |
| rrr      | rra and rrb at the same time. |

At the end, we had to display the operations by listing the used commands.

The final goal was to optimize those operations with varied algorithm.

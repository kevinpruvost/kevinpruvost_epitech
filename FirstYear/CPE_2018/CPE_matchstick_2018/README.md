# CPE_matchstick_2018

## 2nd Project of the second "Elementary Programming in C" module of the Epitech's 1st year program.

The "matchstick" project aimed to be a project that would learn us how to make our first AI's.

In this game, you have varied configurations of matchsticks due to a size argument and a limit </br>
of matchsticks to take.

It looks like this :

The purpose of this 2-players game is to make the opponent take the last matchstick.
For each turn, the players have to take at least 1 matchstick to the maximum authorized by the limit argument. </br>
Each matchstick they take have to be on the same line.

So, for this project, the second player is an AI we had to make.</br>
My AI won 90% of every tests of the Epitech bot.

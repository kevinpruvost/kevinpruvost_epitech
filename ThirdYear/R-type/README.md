# R-Type

## Description

The R-Type project is a "shoot them up" game, playable on networks, based on the original game design of the R-Type game, released in 1987.

For the game engine part, we chose to make a dynamic ECS architecture. As it was dynamic, we could add new classes and objects by loading dynamic libraries at runtime (*.dll or *.so).

We also implemented Google Test & Google Benchmark for testing and optimizing purposes.

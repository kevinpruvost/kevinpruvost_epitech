# Zappy

For this last project of the year, the goal here, was to make AI teams compete against each other to level up the fastest.

Rules :

- Each square of the grid contains and spawns different types of resources.<br/>
- AIs can reach a maximum level of 8. They need different numbers and types of resources for each level they try to go up to.<br/>
But for some levels to attain, they need to merge. For example, if an AI wants to level up to level 5, he will need to merge with 3 other level 4 AIs of its own team.
- AIs can kill or push other AIs.<br/>
- The first AI to reach the maximum level (level 8) makes his team win.

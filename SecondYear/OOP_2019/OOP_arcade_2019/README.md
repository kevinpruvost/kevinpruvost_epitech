### Details

#### Shortcuts

Shortcuts are generated depending on graphical libraries present in the lib/ folder.

Example :

With 'lib_arcade_oeuf.so' & 'lib_arcade_O_O.so', you can use :
./arcade oeuf
./arcade O_O

If you type ./arcade without arguments, then the shortcuts will be displayed.

#### Powering on the arcade machine

The folders architecture needs to stay like it is.
So, to launch the arcade machine, you have to execute the 'arcade' binary like so :

./arcade DISPLAY_LIBRARY

# CCP_plazza_2019

In this project, we had to simulate a restaurant taking orders from a CLI.

The restaurant had to simulate a precise number of cooks, by creating a process for each one. Then they would take orders from the restaurant and split
their time cooking pizzas in the most efficient way possible as they can be assigned a maximum number of pizzas for each of them.

We also had to manage a ingredients stock so that cooks can cook each type and size of pizzas.

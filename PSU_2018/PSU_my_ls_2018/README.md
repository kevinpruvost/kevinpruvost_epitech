# PSU_my_ls_2018

## 1st Project of the second "Unix system programming" module of the Epitech's 1st year program.

In this project, we just had to recreate the ls function at his basics uses.

The conditions were that we had to manage the -l, -R, -r, -d and -t function and the </br>
fact that they can be combined.

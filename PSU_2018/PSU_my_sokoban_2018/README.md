# PSU_my_sokoban_2018

## 2nd Project of the first "Unix system programming" module of the Epitech's 1st year program.

In this project, we had to recreate the Sokoban game. A game where the player had to push every </br>
blocks of a map on a target. When every blocks stand on a target then the player wins.

We had to make it only playable on the Linux terminal and with ASCII characters and with a map given in arguments.

Needless to say, the "ncurses" library was fundamental for this project.
